            Blockchain-based covers have a low claims-to-payout ratio. Existing cover products are unscalable, discretionary, and discriminatory. Smart contract audits do not guarantee security. Attacks on exchanges, metaverses, DApps, and DeFi protocols are increasing and getting more sophisticated.

            Observing a need in the market for a solid parametric DeFi insurance solution, we decided to launch Neptune Mutual.
